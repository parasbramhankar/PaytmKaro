## üìò Project Description: Java Banking System using the core Java (Learning Project)

### üéØ Purpose

This **Java Banking System** is a simple console-based application developed as a **learning project** while exploring Java programming. The project is designed to help understand and implement **object-oriented programming concepts**, **class-based architecture**, and **user interaction** using standard input/output mechanisms in Java.

---

### üõ† Technologies Used

* **Language**: Java
* **Platform**: Console / CLI (Command-Line Interface)
* **Paradigm**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### üì¶ Key Concepts Practiced

| Concept                       | How It's Applied                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Classes & Objects**         | Each functionality is encapsulated in a class (`Customer`, `Account`, `Transactions`, etc.). |
| **Encapsulation**             | Data is hidden within classes and accessed through methods.                                  |
| **Collections**               | Likely used to store multiple accounts (e.g., using `ArrayList`).                            |
| **Conditional Logic & Loops** | Used to display menus and perform user-selected actions repeatedly.                          |
| **Modular Design**            | Code is split into multiple reusable classes to mimic real-life systems.                     |

### üîç What the Project Does

The Banking System simulates a basic set of banking operations that include:

* **Creating a customer and an account**
* **Depositing and withdrawing money**
* **Checking account balance**
* **Viewing customer details**
* **Updating or deleting customer information**

All operations are done through a **text-based menu** and take input from the user via the console.

### üß† What You Learned From This Project

By building this project, you practiced and reinforced:

* Structuring real-world problems using Java classes
* Working with constructors, getters/setters
* Implementing class relationships (composition)
* Writing interactive programs using loops and conditions
* Breaking down a larger problem into smaller logical modules

---

### üìà Future Enhancements (If You Want to Explore More)

* Add **file handling** to save and load customer data.
* Create a **simple login system** with passwords.
* Use **Java Swing or JavaFX** to make a GUI version.
* Integrate with a **database** like MySQL using JDBC.
* Implement **exception handling** for invalid input.

### üßæ Summary

This Banking System project is a great milestone in your Java learning journey. It gives you hands-on experience with Java syntax, OOP design, console input/output, and modular development. While it may not have advanced features or persistence yet, it lays the **foundation for building more complex and scalable applications** in the future.
